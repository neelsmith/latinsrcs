Primary sources are valuable in any classroom, and especially so in introductory language classes.  This project is meant to be a resource that allows a body of work to be searched and adapted for classroom use.  The body of work we have chosen is a collection of Latin inscriptions.  These primary sources are visual evidence of a language that once existed in a time that once was very real.  Through the creation of digital diplomatic editions of the inscriptions, manual analysis of the images, and automated analysis of the texts, we have built a searchable, sortable, and entirely adaptable database of inscriptions.  The process has not only revealed some interesting questions about digital, scholarly, and collaborative work, but has also provided the opportunity to start rethinking how Latin is taught and how that can change with the digital age.

Many, many thanks are due to Prof. Neel Smith, the classics department at the College of the Holy Cross, and the Manuscripts, Documents, and Inscriptions Club, who are so committed to changing the way we do scholarly work.  Without you, none of this would be possible.
