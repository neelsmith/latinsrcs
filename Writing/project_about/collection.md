#The Collection

This project began as a collection of images of Latin inscriptions, which I took during my junior year abroad.  First, I created digital diplomatic editions of the text in each image.  These editions reflect what exactly is going on in every inscription.  Because they are written in markup language, it is possible to run automated analysis on each edition.

In addition, I added a layer of personal analysis to the images.  Within the digital diplomatic editions, characters and places are all tagged with unique identifiers so they are easily and automatically identifiable.  Wherever possible, the images are linked to the corpus reference numbers for the inscriptions.  Finally, because I designed this collection with pedagogy in mind, each image of an inscription is tagged to the specific Latin grammatical topics it illustrates.  These topics are then grouped under more general concepts to make them easier to find.

All of this data was collected in an [RDF graph][RDF].
