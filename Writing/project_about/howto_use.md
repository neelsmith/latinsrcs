#How to use this project

As has been explained above, the material of this project is constructed in an RDF graph, so there are as many access points into the material as there are data members.  In order to make the project most easily accessible, I have highlighted a few access points that I think would be most useful for bringing the material into a classroom or adapting it to a curriculum.

On the [search][search] page, there are four different methods for searching the material, grammatical concept, location, vocabulary, and prosopography, along with a list of abbreviations found in these inscriptions.  Here, it is possible to search for inscriptions found or mentioning a particular location or character, illustrations of a concept, such as the perfect active indicative, as well as search the text of inscriptions for instances of a Latin word.  There are two options for the vocabulary search, either by lemma-form or literal word form.  On the [browse][browse] page, all the images and their corresponding data can be explored.  Finally,  on the [Graph and Visualizations][graph] page, there are a few visualizations of the grammatical parts of the graph.  The hive map displays all the grammatical topics and concepts as they relate to images, and the donut visualization displays the relative distribution of verb forms in the inscriptions in this collection.

It is my goal that, because there are so many different ways to get into the graph, the material can be navigated easily and adapted to fit into any curriculum.  For example, it is easy to collect inscriptions that illustrate a particular grammatical topic or vocabulary item.  Likewise, it is possible to use the material as the foundation for a classroom lesson, such as a study on a character or a place in the Roman Empire.
