	<p>This collection of inscriptions are photographs that I took during my junior year abroad.  They are from various locations throughout Europe - 
	I got into the habit of taking a photo every time I saw some Latin.  Some are classical, some are (relatively) more modern, some are not very well-known, 
	and <a>some are recognizable.</a></p>
