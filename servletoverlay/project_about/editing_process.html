	<p>Each inscription in this project is paired with a <strong>digital 
	diplomatic edition</strong> of the text of the inscription.  This 
	kind of edition of any work is written in XML, or Extensible Markup 
	Language, in order to describe exactly what is going on in an 
	inscription.</p>
	
	<p>In print editions of texts, inscriptions or other larger texts, 
	editors often use visual formatting (e.g. the Leiden Conventions) to 
	encode information about a text, such as gaps or abbreviations.  
	However, visual formatting is not adaptable and it cannot be read by 
	a computer - now that editions of texts can be made available 
	digitally, we have the opportunity to run different automated 
	analyses on large corpora of work if the texts will allow themselves 
	to be automated.  Markup language, such as XML, makes this possible.  
	In addition, writing editions in markup language does not tie the 
	editor to any one visual presentation.  An edition in XML is a source 
	text, and decisions about how it should look can be made and changed 
	without affecting the source text.  Digital diplomatic editions like 
	this are also not stuck to a certain environment or program, like a 
	word processor.  An XML edition is easily integrated into many other 
	things, and it lends itself well to work in 
	<a href="project_about/versioncontrol.html">version control systems</a>.
	Also, when it comes to the actual text of an edition, a digital 
	diplomatic edition has no ambiguity.  Where a print text will identify 
	titles, foriegn words, emphasized words, etc., with italics, a digital 
	diplomatic edition written in XML has specific identifiers for each 
	item.  When an edition is written in markup language, there is no 
	question about what the editor thinks the text is saying.  Finally, the 
	editions written are markup are completely citable, down to each line 
	number, and when they are automatically analyzed by a morphological 
	parser, they are citable down to the specific word.</p>
	
	<p>The text editions in this project are all digital diplomatic 
	editions, within which personal names, places, and abbreviations 
	are identified.  To this, I have added a few manual layers of analysis.
	I created a set of narrow grammatical topics, such as the perfect 
	active indicative or the nominative first declension singular, and 
	connected those topics to examples in the images using Prof. Blackwell's
	and Prof. Smith's Image Citation Service.  Then, I grouped these narrow 
	topics under larger concepts, such as the perfect or the nominative, to 
	allow for easier access into the material.  It is my goal that all the 
	material is searchable, adaptable, and citable.  All options for 
	searching the material can be found <a href="search.html">here</a>.</p>
