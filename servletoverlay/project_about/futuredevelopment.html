	<p>One of the benefits of having a large digital corpus is the ability to automatically collect statistics about the material in the corpus.  When we have data, we can then begin to construct a curriculum.  Rather than working from a prescribed curriculum and trying to find material that fits, it is possible to start from the bottom up, and create a curriculum based on the data.</p>
	<p>It is entirely possible to develop a first Latin course based on the Latin in these inscriptions.  Morphological analysis of the texts shows us that there are 779 unique vocabulary items in this corpus, a comparable number to the 650 unique vocabulary words in the first half of Susan C. Shelmerdine's <em>Introduction to Latin</em> textbook.</p>
	<p>When working from the bottom up, developing a curriculum from data, it is also possible to allow the data to change the typical structure of a first-year Latin course.  Nearly every Latin textbook, Shelmerdine's <em>Introduction to Latin</em> included, teaches the present tense first.  However, in these texts, the distribution of verb forms shows that our material includes overwhelmingly more perfect tense verbs than anything else.  Why not design a course that focuses on the perfect tense first?  This would give the students more exposure to something they will see more often, in this body of work and perhaps elsewhere in Latin.</p>
	<p>Further examination of the data could lead to more changes in the structure of a curriculum.</p>
