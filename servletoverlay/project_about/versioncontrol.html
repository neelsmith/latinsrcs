	<p>All of the work on this project was done using Git, a 
	distributed version control system.  A version control system keeps 
	track of all the changes made to a file or a set of files so that 
	specific versions can be retrieved.  A distributed version control 
	system, such as Git, lets multiple computers &quot;check out&quot; 
	the files under version control, which are called a repository.  When 
	the repository is checked out on multiple servers, it is backed up 
	every time - so if one computer crashes, all the data is not lost.  In 
	addition, all the changes are tracked, and when the repository is 
	pushed back up to the main server, in our case hosted by Github, the 
	changes made on different computers are reconciled and merged together.
	This allows for collaborative work without risk of losing any vital 
	information, since all versions of the repository are stored and can be
	accessed.</p>
	
	<p>Any kind of file can be used in a version control system, but it 
	works best with markup language and plain text, since they are not 
	dependent on any single kind of environment.  This is especially 
	beneficial for collaborative work, because it means I can do my work 
	on a PC, on a Mac, even on a Linux machine, and everything is easily 
	pushed up into the repository and merged.</p>
	
	<p>There are many options for version control systems, but this 
	project uses Git.  Unlike other systems, Git has a web interface 
	called <a href="http://github.com">Github</a>, where the information 
	in the repository can be edited online, further opening up the 
	possibilities for collaboration.  With Github, I do not even need an 
	XML editing software to edit my XML editions, because I can do it 
	directly in the repository.  That being said, Github does not validate
	XML, so I prefer to use an editing software - but for editing on the 
	fly, it is not necessary.  Github also lets users who are not members
	of the repository &quot;fork&quot; the information, that is, make a 
	copy of a repository and make local changes to it.  If the user makes
	changes that he thinks would benefit the whole repository, he can send
	a &quot;pull request&quot; to the owner of the repository, asking to 
	merge his changes with the original material.  This is a powerful tool
	for collaboration on things like coding projects and web development,
	and equally powerful for digital scholarly editing.</p>
	
	<p>The Git repository for this project includes the digital diplomatic
	editions, the groovy scripts that run automated analysis or search 
	through the material, and all the data that makes up the RDF graph, 
	stored in .csv tables.  Browse our 
	Github <a href="http://github.com/neelsmith/latinsrcs">here</a>.</p>
