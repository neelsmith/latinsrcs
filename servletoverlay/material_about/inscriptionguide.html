	<p>At first glance, most Latin inscriptions can be somewhat 
	overwhelming.  There is no punctuation, little spacing between words, 
	and they are full of abbreviations as short as one letter.  The text 
	does not seem like Latin or really any language at all.  However, after 
	some close examination, we may discover that the inscriptions are not 
	as difficult to read as we thought they were.  There are many clues 
	that can help us not only read the text, but also find out more about 
	the artifact.</p>

	<p>The first step when dealing with an inscription is to determine 
	what kind of inscription it is.  Does it dedicate a monument?  Is it 
	an epitaph?  Graffiti?  What is the purpose of the inscription?  This 
	collection includes inscriptions in two main categories, which are:</p>
	
	<ol><li><em>Dedicatory Inscriptions:</em>  These 
	inscriptions are usually found on or relating to a large monument or 
	statue.  Dedicatory inscriptions tell the reader for whom or by whom 
	something was built.  This kind of inscription includes names, often 
	with a string of honorific titles, and sometimes dates.</li>
	<li><em>Epitaphs</em>:  These inscriptions are 
	headstones or monuments honoring someone who has passed away.  They 
	often include names and dates.  Epitaphs nearly always include the 
	abbreviation "D M", which stands for the phrase "<em>Dis Manibus</em>".</li></ol>
		
	<p>This collection also includes some miscellaneous inscriptions, 
	which are anything from a name on a storefront to marketplace 
	advertisements.  There are also a few more modern inscriptions, 
	found in and around Rome, included because of their clarity and 
	because of their use of very straightforward, classical Latin.</p>

	<p>Latin epigraphy is the study of ancient Roman writing.  This is 
	not limited to inscriptions - it also includes writing stamped in 
	metal, painted on a wall, set in a mosaic, or anything else.  The 
	traditional inscription is carved in tufa, a soft volcanic stone 
	that was used by the Romans in nearly everything they built.  
	However, this collection also includes marble inscriptions, painted 
	frescoes, and mosaics.<p>

	<h5>A few frequently-asked-questions</h5>

	<ol><li><em>How do I read this when there is no spacing or punctuation?</em></li>

	<p>Reading Latin epigraphy is not as difficult as it seems.  With 
	practice, it will become easier and easier.  Most inscriptions have 
	little points between every word, which help the reader determine 
	where one word ends and the next begins.  In addition, some 
	inscriptions have a deliberate visual placement:  that is, the text 
	is centered, ordered, and divided into chunks in a very deliberate 
	way.  These sentence chunks mirror the grammatical structure of the 
	text, which aids us in translation.</p>

	<p>For example, consider the {Arch of Septimius Severus}[arch].  
	When you look at the main inscription on the top of the arch, the 
	text looks centered on the monument and some lines are a lot shorter 
	than the others.  This is most likely a purposeful arrangement of the 
	lines.  The {first few lines}[archline1] begin the inscription by 
	announcing for whom the monument was built.  This is a very typical 
	construction for dedicatory inscriptions of this kind:  the understood 
	sentence is "This monument was built..." and the inscription answers 
	"for whom?".  So, the first line is a list of titles related to the 
	emperor, Septimius Severus.  The {third line}[archline3] continues in 
	this pattern, adding that the arch was built not only for Septimius 
	Severus, but also for his son Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (better known 
	to us as Caracalla).  The {fourth line}[archline4] then addresses 
	both men at the same time with adjectives in the plural, and the 
	{fourth line}[archline4} finally describes <em>why</em> the arch is being 
	built for them.</p>

	<p>The fourth line is historically interesting because it was 
	scratched out and written over after the <em>damnatio memoriae</em> 
	of Geta, another son of Septimius Severus, but it can be seen that 
	even the original line was by far the shortest of the inscription.  
	The {fifth line}[archline5], which is entirely one prepositional 
	phrase, seems to be set apart - perhaps <em>because</em> it is 
	entirely one prepositional phrase.</p> 

	<li><em>What do all of those letters mean?</em></li>

	<p>Inscriptions tend to be ripe with abbreviations, which makes 
	sense - carving into stone is hard work, so why write the whole 
	word if you do not really have to?  Some abbreviations are easy 
	to figure out, such as "f" for "filius" or "imp" for "imperator".  
	However, other abbreviations are not used nearly as often.</a>

	<p><a>See a shortlist of the most common abbreviations here.</a></p>

	<li><em>They are using Roman numerals!  How do I tell the difference between a letter and a number?</em></li>

	<p>Sometimes, a bar is drawn over numerals in order to represent 
	thousands.  The rest of the time, there is nothing differentiating 
	numerals from letters, except that a numeral is set apart by small 
	points on each side (like the other words in an inscription).  The 
	following symbols are used for Roman numerals in Latin inscriptions:</p>

	<ul><p><em>I</em> = 1</p>
	<p><em>V</em> = 5</p>
	<p><em>X</em> = 10</p>
	<p><em>L</em> = 50</p>
	<p><em>C</em> = 100</p>
	<p><em>D</em> = 500</p>
	<p><em>Q</em> = 500,000</p></ul>
