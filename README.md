#latinsrcs#

A repository for citable source material for teaching Latin from real texts (epigraphic, numismatic, etc).  Artifacts, images and
texts and images are identified by CITE URNs and CTS URNs. All material can be integrated into a generic
suite of CITE services using the [citemgr] build tool, and exposed as an RDF graph.

The project also includes a customized servlet that provides
some project-specific functions directly from a SPARQL endpoint serving the RDF graph of the project.

Current test sites:

- generic [CITE services][2]
- project [servlet][3]
